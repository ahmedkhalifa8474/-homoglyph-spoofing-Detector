Homoglyph spoofing is a phishing or impersonation attack where visually similar characters (homoglyphs) are substituted into a text—such as a domain name, email address, or URL—to deceive users. These characters may come from different writing systems (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, Greek) or numeric lookalikes.
